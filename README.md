# Project Title: Spectacularly Terrible Captchas

## Purpose:
## For my entry in the 2022 PickHacks Hackathon, I took a "laughter is the best medicine" approach to mental wellbeing to create a browser extension that assigns users with intentionally frustrating "captcha-like" tasks to complete (for the intention to make the user laugh).

# Disclaimer: This Browser Extension was made exclusively for Firefox on Windows 10.

# How to Install:
## Step 1: Ensure that you have React.js and npm installed and updated on your PC
## Step 2: Either clone the repository or download and unzip it.
## Step 3: Navigate to the folder "hackathon-react-app-bjbhdg."
## Step 4: Run "npm run build" on your terminal.
## Step 5: Open up firefox and type into the search bar "about:debugging," clicking on the "This Firefox" button located to the left.
## Step 6: Then, click "Load Temporary Add-on..." underneath the "Temporary Extensions" field.
## Step 7: Finally, navigate to "hackathon-react-app-bjbhdg" and go to the "build" folder to select "index.html."
## Your firefox should now have a new extension located to the top-right, click on it to start using it!
